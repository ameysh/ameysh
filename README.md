# Hi, I'm Amey👋

I’m a Web & Software Engineer with extensive professional experience in handling both large-scale and small-scale projects. My knowledge stems from two Master's degrees: MSc Web Engineering (in progress) from TU Chemnitz, Germany, and MSc Computer Science from MIT-WPU, Pune, India.

## 🏢 Current Role and Previous Experiences
I am currently a part of the Cyber-Physical Systems team at TU Chemnitz, where I contribute to research and development using JavaScript with Python and Django for building backend systems and interactive web applications.

Previously, I have worked at:
- **Deloitte US-India**
- **Ethosh Digital**
- **Harpa Technologies**

## 🎯 Development Philosophy
I understand the importance of effective development and adapting to changing requirements. Using my experience, I develop software grounded in a deep understanding of user needs and focused on delivering a top-quality user experience. I prioritize solutions that are both practical and innovative. My approach involves thorough research and user feedback to ensure that each project exceeds expectations.
