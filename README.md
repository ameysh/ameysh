# Hi, I'm Amey

I’m a Web & Software Engineer with extensive professional experience in handling both large-scale and small-scale projects. My academic background includes two Master's degrees: MSc Web Engineering and MSc Computer Science.

I am currently a full-time student, focusing on modern web architectures, scalable systems, and research-driven development.

Previously, I worked as part of a Cyber-Physical Systems research team, contributing to research and development, building backend systems and interactive web applications. I have also gained professional experience across enterprise-level software projects, technology consulting, digital product development, virtual reality development, and startup-level engineering management.
